  As college freshmen, our team have all seen friends and classmates struggle with trying to find places to live in the coming year. 
  Especially for those of them who are looking for off campus apartments, it can be a real challenge to tell whether or not
  a property is a good fit without any frame of reference. And it doesn't take much for a bad lease or apartment to turn into a 
  nightmare experience. With that in mind, we set out to help them, or anyone who might be looking for an apartment. What 
  we came up with is PadRater. PadRater is an online service that helps first time apartment hunters objectively review and
  grade different apartments they've looked at. Using simple questions without real estate jargon, PadRater grades each
  apartment ona simple letter grade scale. Based on more than twentydistinct metrics ranging from price to size to lease terms,
  PadRater then offers personalized feedback to the user about the pros and cons of the apartment they viewed. Our hope as a team 
  is to provide the type of support that can make users feel at ease as they look for a place to call home process. Because 
  from searching listings to signing leases, with PadRater anyone can be an apartment hunting expert.
